# Group L - Gender Gap in Employment
## Project Goal :
Since women In order to facilitate the gender equality for employment, we decided to take a deep dive analysis into the contributors of gender gap.Through looking into the gender gap of OECD countries, our project objective is to find what variables or aspects are related with gender gap.

## Literature Review 
  Many literature discuss and research about the parental leave policy with gender issues. A research paper in 2008, Ray, Gorick and Schmitt suggest that leave policies can either reinforce or relieve the gender inequality in both work and family. They find the unpaid feature of the FMLA in the U.S. works against women. The reason is that men who usually have a higher income are less likely to take the unpaid leave than women, which then lead more women stay at home to do the care work. (Ray, Gorick and Schmitt, 2008) 

  Most scholars consent the dual earners, dual carers model that the government promote in order to achieve gender equality. Many researches indicate paid parental leave will lead more father to take the leave and allow mothers to stay in the labor force (Bowman, 2014; Zimmerman, 2015)

## Hypothesis 
Based on the literature review, we have the hypothesis that gender gap will be narrowed if government can develop more related policy and provide more support to families. For example, countries has less benefit like parental leave policy, cash allowance for families have wider gender inequality between male and female. 

## Method 
  For the method, we performed an exploratory data analysis to investigate the correlations between variables and gender gap of OECD Countries. Since the data of gender gap in terms of employment rate is more complete compare to family work participation of parent, we mostly analyze the gender gap using the measurement of labor participation. we deployed a relatively small portion of analysis about paid parental leave reserved for father and mother to measure the gender equality since we can understand how much time father and mother contributed in terms of taking care of their children.
  
  Moreover, we specifically conducted a case study of United States to explore more about the specific policies associated with gender equality.


## DATA Selection
We have three dataset for this project:

1. Employment(OECD database):
295,119 observations, includes three key metrics for different age groups in 39 countries: the employment/population ratio, unemployment rate, labor force participation rate

2. Family(OECD database): 
11,639 observations, includes four key metric we care about for 39 countries: gender gap in employment, paid parental leave for mothers and fathers, fertility rate, government social expenditure on family as percentage of GDP

3. Speech: 
Considering presidents will usually present their vision of America and set forth their goals for the nation, thus we collected President's Inaugural Address of US from 1960 to 2022(four-year term),and want to apply text analysis to explore whether president pay attention to "gender gap for employment" or "women unemployment" on their goal for nation. 

We mainly look at the data from 2017 for correlation analysis because COVID-19 impose a huge influence on employment/unemployment for 2019-2022, which will bias the gender gap effect on employment, and government social expenditure data are not comprehensive for 2018. Thus, we choose data of 2017 as our main observations.
