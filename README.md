# Group L - Gender Gap in Employment
## Project Goal :
Since women In order to facilitate the gender equality for employment, we decided to take a deep dive analysis into the contributors of gender gap.Through looking into the gender gap of OECD countries, our project objective is to find what variables or aspects are related with gender gap.


## Hypothesis 
Based on the literature review, we have the hypothesis that gender gap will be will be smaller if government can develop more related policy and provide more subsidy to families. For example, countries has less benefit like parental leave policy, cash allowance for families have wider gender inequality between male and female.
